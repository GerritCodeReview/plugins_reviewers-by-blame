      "message": "It should also support group names.\n\nActually I would love to be able to specify some kind of change query and to define a set of reviewers that should be added when this query matches (similar to how you can specifiy a change query for watching changes). I\u0027m not sure this can be expressed by a single section. Maybe this is a case where we would really need subsections, e.g.\n\n  [add-reviewer \"branch:master\"]\n    reviewer \u003d MyProject-Developers\n    reviewer \u003d qa@test.com",
