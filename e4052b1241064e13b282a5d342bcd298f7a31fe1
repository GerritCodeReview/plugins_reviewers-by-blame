      "message": "I think it\u0027s wrong to do this. This is the old method that was used before cfg.getFromProjectConfigWithInheritance(projectName, pluginName).\n\nThis plugin builds against 2.8-SNAPSHOT and the method rename was done for 2.8 [1] while the version was still 2.8-SNAPSHOT. Means I believe that the plugin fails to build because it gets an old 2.8-SNAPSHOT version. I would rather fix the build by building a new 2.8-SNAPSHOT or by updating the version of the Gerrit-API that is used by this plugin.\n\n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/51233",
